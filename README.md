# 🎨 Virtual Art Gallery  

This is a basic HTML project made for my college assignment.  
The idea is to create a simple **Virtual Art Gallery** using only HTML (no CSS, no JavaScript).

## 📌 Project Description  
The webpage shows 5 artworks of my choice.  
Each artwork has:  
- Title (using `<h2>` or `<h3>`)  
- Image with `alt`, width and height  
- A short description in a `<p>`  
- A link to learn more about the artwork  

The page also includes:  
- Headings and paragraphs  
- Bold, italic, underline, and deleted text  
- Horizontal rules `<hr>` and line breaks `<br>`  
- External links  
- Ordered list (steps to create art)  
- Unordered list (materials used)  
- A table comparing artworks
